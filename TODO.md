# DoWNE — build roadmap

Status snapshot as of the four scaffolding commits (`275b6d9`..`e058a65`). Not
a spec — the spec is CLAUDE.md and `downe_shuttle_implementation_prompt.md`.
This tracks what's built vs. what's still needed to run a real game.

## Done — scaffolding (all four layers wired end-to-end)

- **core/**: `Ship`, `Console`, `ResourceStock`, `PursuitTrack`, `TurnManager`
  (Team/Coordination phases only, no step structure), `GameState`,
  `StarSystem` + `AwayMissionOpportunity` (card-scoring arithmetic only, no
  data), `JumpResolver`, `ShipRegistry` (9 ship ids + display names).
- **net/**: `NetMessage` (flat JSON envelope), `HttpStaticFiles` (path
  resolution + content types), `MessageRouter` (routes 2 message types:
  `set_jump_coordinates`, `set_drive_charged`), `Persistence` (autosave to
  `user://` on mutation, `load_dict()`), `NetServer` (TCPServer sniffing
  WebSocket-upgrade vs. static file, one port for everything).
- **ui/**: `DisplayFormat` (pure formatting), `TVDisplay` (read-only:
  turn/phase + pursuit bar only), `HostConsole` (advance phase, force
  pursuit track, read-only ship list), `Main` composition root wired as
  `run/main_scene`.
- **web/**: browser terminal client (`index.html`/`app.js`/`style.css`) —
  ship picker, freeform coordinates field, drive toggle. This is also the
  ESP32 hardware-failure fallback per CLAUDE.md.
- **tests/**: 10 headless test files, `run_tests.gd` walks `tests/`
  recursively. All passing.

None of this has real game content yet — it's plumbing. A game cannot
actually be run with what exists today: there's no starting fleet, no star
systems, no shuttles, no Wolf Attack data.

## Answered

From `downe_shuttle_implementation_prompt.md`'s open questions:

- [x] **Mining operations**: the operator picks one (materials or ore) per
      operation, and gets 2 operations per turn (3 if `requires_fuel`),
      choosing independently each time.
- [x] **Cargo/hold capacities**: per-ship starting resources are in
      `resources.md`. Caps themselves are *still* unspecified there too —
      treat as uncapped (`-1` placeholder) for now, as the brief already
      suggested.
- [x] **`ally` and `wobbly` home ship**: `ally` → Quellon, `wobbly` →
      Shepherd.
- [x] **`endeavour` and `maliades` home bay**: Endeavour → Shepherd,
      Maliades → Dione.

Also resolved along the way:

- [x] **`material` vs `materials` naming**: standardized on **materials**
      (plural) — matches the printed sheets and `resources.md`. Renamed
      `ResourceStock.Kind.MATERIAL` → `MATERIALS` and fixed CLAUDE.md's
      glossary line to match (commit pending).

## Newly available — `resources.md`

An untracked `resources.md` already in the repo (from the *DoWNE
Facilitator Guide v1.0.1*, p.5) covers most of "starting fleet setup":

- Per-ship starting resources (ore/fuel/food/water/materials) and
  security-team counts, machine-readable as a `STARTING_RESOURCES` dict.
- Starting survivor population per ship (the evacuation ceiling — crew/
  passenger capacity numbers on the sheets are flavor only, not enforced).
- Starting unrest: every ship begins at 0; 8+ calls the facilitator
  (mutiny) — not modeled anywhere in `core/` yet.
- Explicitly flags what's still *not* in the source: shuttle starting
  cargo/caps, ship hold caps, starting console state, starting fighter
  counts. Same "treat as uncapped / assume empty, confirm before
  playtest" posture as the open questions above.

## Blocked — still need answers

- [ ] **Star systems**: the lettered roster (A, B, C…), descriptions, and
      away-mission opportunities (skill + difficulty) — `StarSystem` and
      `AwayMissionOpportunity` exist as empty containers with no data.
- [ ] **Wolf Attack data**: Wolf ship roster, attack-strength scaling off
      the pursuit track, battle-table numbers. Only the pursuit track
      itself (0–10, rise/fall) exists; nothing about what an attack does.
- [ ] **Suspicion / secret objectives**: CLAUDE.md's Runtime topology
      mentions player-phone pages for these, but there's no data model or
      content for either yet (loyalty itself is explicitly paper-only, no
      UI — that one's settled).
- [ ] **Turn phase structure**: the shuttle brief references "Team Phase
      Maintenance Step 6" — implying Team Phase has an internal step
      sequence the host needs to be walked through. `TurnManager` currently
      only has two flat phases, no steps.
- [ ] **Unrest**: `resources.md` establishes starting unrest (0) and the
      mutiny threshold (8+) but nothing in `core/` tracks it yet — no
      `Ship.unrest` field, no rules for what raises/lowers it.

None of these block the craft/shuttle system below — they block star
systems, Wolf Attacks, secret-info phone pages, and a stepped Team Phase
respectively.

**Update**: three more source documents landed in the repo since the above
was written (`open_questions_answered.md`, `ships.md`) and resolve nearly
all of it in full detail — star system topology + away mission data, full
console rosters, Wolf Attack ship roster/scaling/battle tables, the
complete suspicion/secret-info system, and the Team Phase step sequence.
These are now "answered, ready to build" rather than "blocked" - each
still has a couple of source-level open items called out inline (e.g. the
unlabelled −5 pursuit band, the FG-vs-printed-card suspicion values for
Universal Arbourage/Android). See those two files directly rather than
this summary when starting each system - they're thorough.

New from `ships.md`: a third vessel class, **Small Ships** (`gorgoneion`,
`capybara`, `warrior`, `vulcan`, `voyage_33_0`) - 5 optional/crisis
vessels, own population/unrest, own console set, but *cannot take
damage* and must dock with one of the 6 core ships every Team Phase and
Wolf Attack. Not part of the base starting fleet (`resources.md` and the
"only craft" decision above both confirm the base fleet is exactly the 6
core ships). Tracked as its own future system, not folded into
`FleetSetup` or the craft/shuttle system.

## Done — starting fleet setup

- [x] `core/fleet_setup.gd` — builds a fresh `GameState`'s 6 ships from
      `resources.md`'s starting resources/security teams/population, and
      the console roster from `open_questions_answered.md` §2.2 /
      cross-validated against `ships.md`. Unrest starts at 0. Consoles
      start undamaged and uncharged.
- [x] Wired into `ui/main.gd` — a fresh run now starts with the real
      fleet instead of an empty `GameState`. Verified end-to-end: booted
      the real app headlessly and confirmed via HTTP that it serves.
- [x] `Ship.unrest` field added (just the counter — no rules for what
      raises/lowers it yet, that's still open, see Blocked above).
- [x] `Console.charged` field added (was missing entirely — needed to
      represent "uncharged" at setup).
- [x] `ResourceStock.Kind.SECURITY_TEAMS` added (was missing — security
      teams are a transferable resource per the shuttle brief).
- [x] Fixed a real ship/craft naming collision found along the way:
      `ShipRegistry` used to list 9 "ships" (including Endeavour,
      Maliades, Pallas), but those three are craft names, not ships —
      confirmed with you. `ShipRegistry`, `CLAUDE.md`'s Ships table, and
      `web/app.js`'s mirrored ship list are all fixed to the real 6.

This was a prerequisite for the craft system below (shuttles need real
ships to dock at) and is now satisfied.

## Done — core/craft system

- [x] `core/craft/craft_definitions.gd` — the full roster (14 shuttles + 3
      fighter wings) as data via `CraftDefinition.from_dict()`, not
      per-craft classes. `ally`/`wobbly`/`endeavour`/`maliades` home ships
      match the resolved open questions.
- [x] `core/craft/craft_state.gd` + `craft_setup.gd` — per-craft mutable
      state (docked ship, fuelled, cargo `ResourceStock`, combat damage,
      fighter count, scout report, generic per-turn use counter), seeded
      for all 17 craft, docked at home ship, empty/unfuelled (per
      `resources.md`'s recommendation), fighter wings full at 4
      (unconfirmed default — flagged there too).
- [x] `core/craft/ability.gd` + `ability_check.gd` + `ability_result.gd` +
      `ability_registry.gd` + `core/craft/abilities/*.gd` — all 12
      abilities (`cargo_transfer`, `boarding_support[_elite]`, `redeploy`,
      `repair`, `recharge`, `scout_system`, `console_upgrade`,
      `mining_operations`, `resource_harvesting`, `away_mission`,
      `combat_table`), each with `can_execute()`/`execute()`. All
      randomness rolls against `GameState.rng` (seeded, exposed in
      `to_dict()`), never global `randi()`.
- [x] `GameState._on_phase_changed()` clears console charge and craft
      fuel/per-turn uses on every new Team Phase.
- [x] `core/craft/storage_damage.gd` — Storage-console-damage halving,
      including docked shuttles' cargo, with the exact rounding rule
      (5 → 3) tested.
- [x] `combat_table` ability — Maliades/Highwall/fighter-wing profiles as
      dice-roll arithmetic only, never an automated resolver. Fighter
      wings check their home ship's Fighter Bay console is charged and
      undamaged before they can join combat, but not for away missions.
- [x] 9 test files, 21 test files total in the suite, all passing —
      covers every case the brief's §6 asked for by name (fuel clearing,
      `requires_fuel` rejection reasons, repair cost/caps, consent-gated
      console damage, storage halving at value 5, cargo-type rejection,
      fighter launch preconditions, Maliades destroyed at exactly 3
      damage, table-driven ability-id resolution) plus per-ability
      coverage beyond that list.
- [x] Wired into `ui/main.gd`; verified end-to-end with the real app
      booted headlessly over HTTP.

**Deliberately deferred, not silently skipped:**
- `console_upgrade`'s materials cost — no source document gives the
  actual per-box cost, only that the track has 5 boxes (4 on Dione's VIP
  Lounge). Increments `Console.upgrade_level`, charges nothing. Flagged
  loudly in the ability's own file comment.
- `recharge`'s "consoles with an immediate maintenance-cycle effect
  trigger now instead" — sets `Console.charged = true` only; no console
  effect is implemented yet for any console (that's the Maintenance
  Cycle system, still blocked below).
- Maliades' and fighter wings' medium-range "shift a Wolf ship's target
  number" option, and Maliades' Shuttle-Bay repair-on-fuel — both need a
  Wolf ship model that doesn't exist yet (see Blocked, above).
- `repair`'s "2 consoles on 1 ship, 2 ships when fuelled" — implemented
  as literally that (not required to be the *same* ship across calls);
  not cross-checked against a source example, since the brief didn't
  flag this one as ambiguous.

## Backlog — plumbing gaps in what's already scaffolded

- [ ] **Broadcast wiring**: `NetServer.send()`/`broadcast()` exist but
      nothing calls them — connected web/ESP32 clients never get pushed
      state updates when someone else mutates `GameState`. Right now the
      web terminal is fire-and-forget only.
- [ ] **Crash-recovery rehydration**: `Persistence.load_dict()` exists but
      nothing turns that dict back into a live `GameState` on startup —
      `main.gd` doesn't call it. Needs a `GameState.from_dict()`
      (`Ship.from_dict()`, etc.) counterpart to `to_dict()`.
- [ ] **Host console completeness**: only pursuit track and turn phase
      have override controls right now. Per-ship resource/console editing,
      direct jump-coordinate override, and (once it exists) craft admin
      controls are all missing — most state still has no host bypass path,
      which is a direct gap against constraint 5.
- [ ] **TV display completeness**: currently just a turn/phase line and a
      text pursuit bar. No ship status overview, no Wolf Attack support
      screen, no jump/scout announcement feed.
- [ ] **Deployment**: no export preset configured; no plan yet for how the
      12 ESP32 terminals discover the host's IP on the GL.iNet router
      (static IP? mDNS?). ESP32 firmware itself is out-of-repo work in a
      different codebase.
- [ ] **Player phone pages** (`web/`): only the ship terminal exists.
      Suspicion and secret-objective pages need their data model settled
      (see Blocked, above) before they can be built.
